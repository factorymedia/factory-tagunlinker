Episode 2 from the Norsemen at Folgefonna follows the spring edit theme in the <a href="http://whitelines.com/videos/wltv/fridays-fonna-with-len-jorgensen-viktor-wiberg-and-more.html">first episode</a> nicely. It seems that the snowboarding talent coming out of Norway, although not a new occurrence, has no bounds at the moment.

The <a href="http://whitelines.com/videos/wltv/rk-1-crew-tear-vierli-norway-a-new-one.html">recent edits</a> from the <a href="http://whitelines.com/tag/rk1">RK1</a> crew especially come to mind and although this edit has more of a lighthearted shred in the sun vibe, the impressive snowboarding comes through strong.

This is highlighted a couple of minutes in by what could potentially be a new double cork! Doubles have been a staple in professional snowboarding for a bit now and while a growing number of riders are dipping three times, its refreshing to see that some are still progressing the two.

<a href="http://whitelines.com/tag/emil-fossheim">Emil Fossheim</a> is the man who puts it down - its some sort of double front flip with an extra spin.

Whether or not it's completely new, the end result looks pretty sick. I mean the jump isn't very big yet he manages to keep his style throughout. And while he may scrub the landing a little, given the slushy conditions, I think we can let that slide can't we?
